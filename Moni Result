Here are the 34 incorrect answers you provided, along with the correct answers/solutions for each:

❌ Q12

Your Answer: /var/log
Correct Answer: touch /var/log/logfile
Reason: /var/log is a directory. You need to use touch to create a placeholder file.

❌ Q13

Your Answer: cp -r
Correct Answer: cp -a source destination
Reason: -a preserves all attributes and recursively copies.

❌ Q16

Your Answer: 'rm filename' it asks for confirmation, if not you give 'rm -f filename'
Correct Answer: rm -i
Reason: rm by default does not ask for confirmation. rm -i makes it interactive.

❌ Q17

Your Answer: rm -r '*.tmp'
Correct Answer: find . -name '*.tmp' -delete
Reason: rm -r '*.tmp' won’t recurse into subdirectories properly. find is safer.

❌ Q19

Your Answer: tar -cvf multiple reports.tar /archive
Correct Answer: mv report1 report2 /archive/
Reason: Use mv to move files, not tar.

❌ Q25

Your Answer: find -iname "ERROR" app.log
Correct Answer: grep -i ERROR app.log
Reason: grep is used to search inside files. find is for filenames.

❌ Q27

Your Answer: dd - deleting '#' in vi editor
Correct Answer: grep -v '^#' /etc/fstab
Reason: grep -v is used to exclude lines; dd deletes text in vi, not for viewing.

❌ Q29

Your Answer: sed 's/DEBUG/d' log file
Correct Answer: sed '/DEBUG/d' logfile
Reason: s/DEBUG/d is invalid; to delete lines, you use /pattern/d.

❌ Q30

Your Answer: cat file1 file2 > file.txt
Correct Answer: paste file1 file2 > file.txt
Reason: cat appends; paste merges line-by-line.

❌ Q33

Your Answer: chmod -R 111 /opt/data/*
Correct Answer: chmod -R a-x /opt/data
Reason: 111 gives execute-only permission, which is unsafe. Use a-x to remove execute permission.

❌ Q34

Your Answer: Verbose description
Correct Answer: rwxr-xr-x
Reason: chmod 755 translates to this permission string.

❌ Q39

Your Answer: Check if user has write permission
Correct Answer: check file permissions with ls -l
Reason: Need to confirm via ls -l, not general reasoning.

❌ Q41

Your Answer: sar -A
Correct Answer: du -sh *
Reason: sar shows performance; du shows directory space usage.

❌ Q43

Your Answer: ps -ef | grep -n 10
Correct Answer: ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head or top
Reason: grep -n is not for sorting CPU usage.

❌ Q44

Your Answer: ps -ef | grep -i 8080
Correct Answer: lsof -i :8080
Reason: lsof shows port usage, ps only lists processes.

❌ Q45

Your Answer: kill processid or kill -1 processid
Correct Answer: kill PID or kill -15 PID
Reason: -1 is not the right signal. Use -15 (TERM) or -9 (KILL).

❌ Q46

Your Answer: sar -U 2 3
Correct Answer: mpstat -P ALL 2
Reason: mpstat is better for per-core CPU; sar -U also works but not ideal.

❌ Q47

Your Answer: du -sh shows size, df -h shows space
Correct Answer: df -h shows disk free, du -sh shows directory size
Reason: Your answer is vague. Required specific wording on difference.

❌ Q48

Your Answer: free -m
Correct Answer: swapon --show
Reason: free gives summary; swapon shows actual swap file usage.

❌ Q49

Your Answer: if process is not running it is zombie
Correct Answer: ps aux | grep Z
Reason: Zombie ≠ Not running. Use ps to detect zombie processes (state = Z).

❌ Q50

Your Answer: ps -ef |grep -i processid
Correct Answer: ps -ef | grep process_name
Reason: Process ID is numeric; you usually use the name or ps -p PID.

❌ Q59

Your Answer: curl -l
Correct Answer: curl -I url
Reason: -I fetches headers only. -l is invalid.

❌ Q60

Your Answer: wget https://tarball.tar.gz
Correct Answer: wget -O custom.tar.gz https://tarball.tar.gz
Reason: You didn’t specify custom filename using -O.

❌ Q64

Your Answer: rpm -iq /etc/httpd.conf/httpd.conf
Correct Answer: rpm -qf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Reason: -qf tells which package owns a file.

❌ Q65

Your Answer: rpm -ivh ngnix
Correct Answer: rpm -ql nginx
Reason: -ivh is for installing. To list files, use -ql.

❌ Q69

Your Answer: gzip /home/user.gz
Correct Answer: zip -r archive.zip /home/user
Reason: gzip compresses single files. Use zip for directories.

❌ Q70

Your Answer: gzip -d project.zip.gz
Correct Answer: unzip project.zip
Reason: gzip doesn’t work on .zip. Use unzip.

❌ Q71

Your Answer: gzip -k report.txt.gz
Correct Answer: gzip -k report.txt
Reason: You added .gz manually which isn’t needed.

❌ Q72

Your Answer: tar -tvf data.txt.gz
Correct Answer: zcat data.txt.gz or gunzip -c
Reason: tar doesn’t read .gz unless it’s a tarball. Use zcat.

❌ Q34

Your Answer: Verbose explanation
Correct Answer: chmod 755 = rwxr-xr-x
Reason: Expected permission string as answer.

❌ Q33

Your Answer: chmod -R 111 /opt/data/*
Correct Answer: chmod -R a-x /opt/data
Reason: 111 gives execute-only. You need to remove execute, not give it.

❌ Q40

Your Answer: chmod g:qa:r /data/test.log
Correct Answer: setfacl -m g:qa:r /data/test.log
Reason: chmod doesn’t work with group names unless group owns file. ACL needed.

❌ Q29

Your Answer: sed 's/DEBUG/d' log file
Correct Answer: sed '/DEBUG/d' logfile
Reason: Typo in sed pattern. Wrong syntax for deletion.
