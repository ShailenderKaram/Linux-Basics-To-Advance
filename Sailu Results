❌ 1. Re-run a complex command from history

Your Answer:

history & !history number


✅ Correct Answer:

history        # To view past commands
!<number>      # To re-run a specific command by its number


Or use reverse search:

Ctrl + r       # Then type part of the command


💡 Explanation:
The & and !history number are incorrect syntax. You use !<number> (e.g., !105) to re-run a command by its number from history.

❌ 2. Extract only lines with "ERROR" from syslog

Your Answer:

sed -i "ERROR" /var/log/syslog


✅ Correct Answer:

grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog


💡 Explanation:
sed -i is for editing files, not filtering. To extract matching lines, grep is the correct tool.

❌ 3. Remove all commented lines from /etc/fstab

Your Answer:

sed '#/d' /etc/fstab


✅ Correct Answer:

sed '/^#/d' /etc/fstab


💡 Explanation:
The correct pattern to match lines starting with # is ^#. The original command is not valid sed syntax.

❌ 4. Edit /etc/hosts without permissions

Your Answer:

vi /etc/hosts

Editing system files like /etc/hosts requires elevated (root) permissions. sudo is needed.

❌ 5. Find top 10 largest folders in /var/log

Your Answer:

df -ah /var/log | sort -rh | heand n-10


✅ Correct Answer:

du -sh /var/log/* | sort -rh | head -n 10


💡 Explanation:

df shows disk partitions, not folder sizes.

du is used to find the size of directories.

Also, heand n-10 is a typo for head -n 10.
