Use Case: Identifying log directories consuming excessive disk space.

Q: How do you verify if your application server is running out of RAM?
Use Case: Application latency suspected due to memory exhaustion.

Q: Which command helps you identify the top CPU-consuming process in real time?
Use Case: System suddenly becomes slow, and you need to check live CPU hogs.

Q: How do you find the PID of nginx to restart or kill it?
