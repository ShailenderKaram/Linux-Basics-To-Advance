🐧 Real-time Linux Issues & Troubleshooting (End-to-End)
🔹 1. Disk Full – /var filled up overnight

Issue: Application failed because logs could not be written.

Investigation:

df -h            # check which partition is full
du -sh /var/*    # find which folder consumes space
ls -lh /var/log  # check large log files


Resolution:

Compressed old logs: gzip /var/log/*.log.1

Archived and moved to backup server: rsync -av /var/log/*.gz backup:/logs/

Added logrotate configuration to prevent future issues.

🔹 2. High CPU Usage – System slow

Issue: Users complained app was very slow.

Investigation:

top -o %CPU       # identify top CPU consuming processes
ps -ef | grep pid # confirm process details
sar -u 5 5        # monitor CPU usage over time


Resolution:

Found a runaway Java process → killed it: kill -9 <PID>

Restarted service via systemctl.

Tuned JVM memory parameters to prevent recurrence.

🔹 3. Memory Leak

Issue: Swap usage keeps increasing; system becomes unresponsive.

Investigation:

free -h
top -o %MEM
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head


Resolution:

Found a Python app consuming 80% memory.

Restarted app → systemctl restart app.service.

Informed dev team to fix memory leak.

Added monitoring alert on memory usage.

🔹 4. Server Not Reachable via SSH

Issue: Team unable to SSH into server.

Investigation (via console or AWS/GCP console):

systemctl status sshd
ss -tulpn | grep 22
firewall-cmd --list-ports


Resolution:

Restarted SSH: systemctl restart sshd

Added firewall rule: firewall-cmd --add-port=22/tcp --permanent

Checked /etc/ssh/sshd_config for PermitRootLogin.

Verified security group rule on cloud (AWS).

🔹 5. Permission Denied on File

Issue: Developer couldn’t update /var/www/html/index.html.

Investigation:

ls -l /var/www/html/index.html
getfacl /var/www/html/index.html


Resolution:

File was owned by root. Changed ownership:

chown apache:apache /var/www/html/index.html
chmod 664 /var/www/html/index.html


Verified access.

🔹 6. Service Down After Reboot

Issue: Apache didn’t start automatically after reboot.

Investigation:

systemctl status httpd
journalctl -xe | grep httpd


Resolution:

Fixed misconfigured httpd.conf.

Enabled auto-start: systemctl enable httpd.

Restarted service successfully.

🔹 7. Crontab Job Not Running

Issue: Backup script didn’t execute.

Investigation:

crontab -l
grep CRON /var/log/cron


Resolution:

Found script had Windows-style line endings.

Fixed with: dos2unix backup.sh.

Corrected cron entry with absolute paths.

Tested manually before re-adding to crontab.

🔹 8. Mount Not Persistent After Reboot

Issue: Extra disk unmounted after reboot.

Investigation:

lsblk
cat /etc/fstab


Resolution:

Added mount entry in /etc/fstab:

/dev/sdb1  /data  xfs  defaults  0 0


Mounted manually: mount -a.

🔹 9. High Load Average

Issue: Server load > 20, while CPU is idle.

Investigation:

uptime
iostat -x 1 5
sar -d 1 5


Resolution:

Found heavy I/O on /dev/sdb.

Tuned DB queries.

Increased IOPS on cloud disk.

🔹 10. SELinux Blocking Application

Issue: App failed to bind to port 8080.

Investigation:

ausearch -m avc -ts recent
getsebool -a | grep httpd


Resolution:

Allowed port with SELinux:

semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8080
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1


Restarted service.

🔹 11. Kernel Panic After Update

Issue: Server not booting.

Investigation:

Used recovery mode → grub2-editenv list.

Booted into previous kernel.

Resolution:

Removed faulty kernel: dnf remove kernel-<version>.

Set stable kernel as default: grub2-set-default.

🔹 12. Application Port Already in Use

Issue: Nginx failed to start.

Investigation:

ss -tulpn | grep 80


Resolution:

Found httpd running on port 80.

Stopped Apache: systemctl stop httpd.

Disabled on boot: systemctl disable httpd.

Restarted Nginx.

🔹 13. Rsync Backup Fails with Permission Denied

Issue: Rsync job fails between servers.

Investigation:

Checked SSH access.

Checked ownership of destination directory.

Resolution:

Fixed permissions with chown -R backupuser:backup /backup/.

Enabled passwordless SSH keys.

Retested rsync.

🔹 14. User Locked Out

Issue: User ravi unable to login.

Investigation:

passwd -S ravi
faillog -u ravi


Resolution:

Found account locked after failed attempts.

Unlocked: usermod -U ravi.

Reset password.

🔹 15. SAR Shows Network Errors

Issue: Random packet loss reported.

Investigation:

sar -n DEV 1 5
ethtool eth0


Resolution:

Found NIC errors.

Restarted network interface.

Requested hardware replacement.
