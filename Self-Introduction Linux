🐧 Self-Introduction (Linux Administrator/Engineer)
🔹 General Interview Introduction

"Hi, my name is Mounika, and I have been working as a Linux Administrator for the past X years. My day-to-day responsibilities include managing Linux servers, performing user and group administration, disk partitioning and LVM management, monitoring system performance using tools like top, sar, and iostat, as well as automating tasks using shell scripting and cron jobs.

I have hands-on experience in troubleshooting real-time issues such as disk space problems, high CPU utilization, service failures, and permission-related issues. I also work with configuration files like /etc/fstab for permanent mounts, manage swap space for performance tuning, and handle security aspects using ACLs, sudo, and SELinux.

In addition, I have experience with tools like rsync for backups, crontab for scheduling jobs, and monitoring solutions like sysstat (SAR). My focus is always on minimizing downtime, ensuring system stability, and automating repetitive tasks wherever possible."
